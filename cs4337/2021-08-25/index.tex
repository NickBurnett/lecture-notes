  \maketitle
  \section{Reasons for Studying Concepts of Programming}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Increased capacity to express ideas
    \item Better understanding of implementation
    \item Increased ability to learn a new language
    \item Better use of languages that are already known
    \item Advancement of computing power
  \end{itemize}
  \topic{Programming Domains}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Scientific Applications
    \item Business Applications
    \item Artificial Intelligence
    \item Web Software
  \end{itemize}
  \topic{Language Evaluation Criteria}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Readability
    \item Writability
    \item Reliability
    \item Cost
    \item Simplicity
    \item \textbf{Feature Multiplicity:} more than one way to utilize a Feature
    \item \textbf{Operator Overload:} operators can have more than one meaning
  \end{itemize}
  \topic{Orthogonality}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item set of primitive constructs
    \item a number of ways to combine them
    \item every combination is legal or meaningful
    \item lack of orthoginality means exceptions
    \item related to simplicity
    \item mix and match operators and variables to produce an output. being highly orthogonal means complexity, while keeping everything legal and meaningful
  \end{itemize}
  \topic{Data Types}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item are the types of data in the language adequate for the language's use case?
    \item are the types of data useful to the programmer?
  \end{itemize}
  \topic{Syntax Design}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item is the language writable? does it suck in the syntax department?
    \item does it suck to write?
  \end{itemize}
